# Sarima Model Research

Personal research into the SARIMA model for Time Series Forecasting. The Notebook file contains visualizations, theory, mathematical background, and code examples in Python. Research is first performed on the smaller model components that SARIMA consists of, and then finally SARIMA itself. Also contains a small section on Holt Winters which needs expansion. In order, the researched models are:

- Autoregressive model (AR)
- Moving Average model (MA)
- Autoregressive Moving Average model (ARMA)
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA)
- Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model (SARIMA)
- Holt Winters (HW)

SARIMA's mathematical formula:
